Before coming to how to download the game, I first of all want to tell you why I chose a pong game:
One of the first games ever created was the Pong Game. Since I wanted to experience how it was like to program such a game back then, I myself decided to code such a game with almost no help. I chose this project to start my programming journey, where the great minds of past generations started. 
I hope that you enjoy my game and may start at the same starting point and become fascinated by what programming can do. I already did!



How to run the Code:

1. Download the files as zip

4. Run the code and enjoy the Pong Game with someone!
